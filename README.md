# Introduction
Approximately 70% of data science problems involve classification and logistic regression is a common solution for binary problems. Logistic regression has many applications in data science, but in the world of healthcare, it can really drive life-changing action.
Detected breast cancer by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based off its characteristics.

# Independent Variables
This is a logistic regression model to identify correlations between the following 9 independent variables and the class of the tumor (benign or malignant).
1. Clump thickness
2. Uniformity of cell size
3. Uniformity of cell shape
4. Marginal adhesion
5. Single epithelial cell
6. Bare Nuclei
7. Bland chromatin
8. Normal nucleoli
8. Mitoses

Logistic regression can identify important predictors of breast cancer using odds ratios and generate confidence intervals that provide additional information for decision-making. Model performance depends on the ability of the radiologists to accurately identify findings on mammograms.
